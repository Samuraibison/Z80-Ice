PIC18F26K83
-----------

Read performance        :  667 KB/s
Write same performance  :  612 KB/s
Write blank performance :  100 KB/s
Write new performance   :   52 KB/s

Write test took 19.5s to run

128 byte page write or erase takes 2.5ms max.


PIC18F27Q43
-----------

Read performance        :  805 KB/s
Write same performance  :  665 KB/s
Write blank performance :  154 KB/s
Write new performance   :   90 KB/s

Write test took 56s to run

256 byte page write takes 10ms max. and page erase take 11ms max.

128 byte equivalence to K83 is 5ms which means Q43 flash performance is half of K83 chips.


N.B. Because the PIC clock stops on every sector write, the internal timers
     aren't accurate and results are higher than they should be.
