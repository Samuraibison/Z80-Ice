# Z80-Ice

**Work in Progress:** This project is still under development, and not all files are currently available.

## Foreword

All the source for this project was originally developed by **Dave Adshead**, under his company **Debug Innovations**. Unfortunately, Dave passed away in May 2025, so the resources here have been released for anybody interested in using it.
