File Buffer_Delay_HC.png
------------------------

CPU clock is 16MHz in the picture

Yellow: Clock on Elektor board (source of Z80 clock)
Blue:   Z80 clock on ICE (about 4ns delayed from yellow trace)
Pink:   nMREQ output of Z80 on ICE
Green:  nMREQ on Elektor board (16ns delayed)

All the control signals go through 74HC244 buffers and some gates.
The gates don't delay the signals much so the HC244's are responsible
for the majority of the 16ns delay.


ICE and debugger seem to stop working above ~18.3MHz (won't step properly)



File Buffer_Delay_AC.png
------------------------

Same probes as above.

U9 (74HC244 buffer) changed for a 74AC244.
nMREQ delay is now 10ns, an improvement of 6ns.
Edges are faster and overshoot at the Elektor board.

Still works at 18MHz but no higher.


Update: Runs at 20MHz, steps most instructions but ADD A,B doesn't step
(it appears to see the breakpoint on the ADD and fail to start).
