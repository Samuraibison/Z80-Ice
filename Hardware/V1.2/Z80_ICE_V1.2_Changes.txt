Z80 ICE Changes V1.1->V1.2
==========================


Electrical
----------

 1. ZVCC can be higher than VCC (from USB) so the PIC ZVCC pin has been potted down

 2. The PIC GND pins are not connected together directly - extra vias added

 3. USB trace routing improved (tracks ran together for a short distance - differential impedance)

 4. Target Vcc is quite noisy - added a cap at the connector

 5. BUSY LED (D3) turned round so it is the same way round as the other LEDs

 6. C14 moved further away from U4

 7. Legend placement improved, no legends are under parts anymore
